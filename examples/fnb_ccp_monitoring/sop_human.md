# SOP: CCP temperature monitoring – cold storage

## 1. Purpose
To ensure that cold storage areas used for raw materials, work-in-progress, and finished food products are maintained within defined temperature limits to control food safety hazards.

## 2. Scope
This SOP applies to all refrigerated cold storage units identified as Critical Control Points (CCPs) under the site HACCP plan.

## 3. Roles and responsibilities
- **Operator / Storekeeper:** Monitor temperature, respond to alarms, take immediate corrective actions, record observations.
- **Supervisor:** Review records, support corrective actions, escalate repeated or unresolved issues.
- **Food Safety / QA:** Assess deviations, determine product disposition, approve corrective actions, update HACCP records as required.

## 4. Definitions
- **CCP (Critical Control Point):** A step at which control can be applied to prevent or eliminate a food safety hazard.
- **Temperature deviation:** Any recorded temperature outside the defined CCP limit.

## 5. Preconditions and inputs
- CCP temperature limits are defined in the HACCP plan (for example, ≤ 5°C).
- Temperature monitoring device or system is operational.
- Product identification and storage location are known.

## 6. Procedure

### 6.1 Monitoring
1. Monitor cold storage temperature using the installed monitoring system or manual check at defined intervals.
2. Review alarms or alerts indicating temperature deviation.

### 6.2 Immediate corrective action
3. If temperature exceeds the CCP limit:
   - identify affected products
   - segregate and place affected products on hold
   - prevent further distribution or use
4. Take reasonable steps to restore temperature control (for example, close doors, check power supply, inform maintenance).

### 6.3 Notification and documentation
5. Inform the supervisor and Food Safety/QA if the deviation is not immediately resolved or if product safety may be affected.
6. Record:
   - date and time of deviation
   - observed temperature
   - duration (if known)
   - affected products and quantities
   - actions taken

### 6.4 Evaluation and disposition
7. Food Safety/QA evaluates the deviation against HACCP criteria and determines product disposition.
8. Only Food Safety/QA may authorize release, rework, or disposal of affected product.

## 7. Records
- CCP monitoring log
- Deviation/corrective action record
- Product disposition record (if applicable)
