# SOP: Temperature excursion handling (storage or transport)

## 1. Purpose
To define the procedure for responding to a temperature excursion affecting materials or products that require controlled storage or transport, ensuring timely containment, assessment, and documentation.

## 2. Scope
This SOP applies to temperature excursions for any material, intermediate, or finished product stored or transported under defined temperature conditions (for example, 2–8°C) at this site or by approved logistics providers.

## 3. Roles and responsibilities
- **Operator / Warehouse staff:** Detect excursion, place affected items on hold, document initial details, notify QA.
- **Supervisor:** Support containment actions and ensure records are completed.
- **Quality assurance (QA):** Evaluate the excursion, determine disposition, approve any return to use, initiate deviation/CAPA as required.

## 4. Definitions
- **Temperature excursion:** Any event where recorded temperature is outside the defined storage/transport range for the applicable material.
- **Hold:** Physical and system status indicating the material is not available for use until QA disposition.

## 5. Preconditions and inputs
- Approved storage/transport range is defined in the applicable specification or label.
- Temperature monitoring device is in place (data logger, probe, or system sensor).
- Affected batch/lot identifiers are available.

## 6. Procedure

### 6.1 Detection and immediate containment
1. When an excursion is detected (alarm, dashboard alert, or data review), identify the affected material(s) and batch/lot number(s).
2. Segregate the affected material(s) and apply **HOLD** status:
   - apply physical hold label
   - update inventory/system status to hold, if applicable
3. Prevent further use or dispatch of affected material(s) until QA disposition.

### 6.2 Notification
4. Notify QA as soon as practical after hold is applied.
5. Notify the supervisor if the excursion affects in-process operations, scheduled manufacturing, or shipment release.

### 6.3 Initial documentation
6. Record the following:
   - date and time excursion was detected
   - location (cold room, refrigerator ID, shipper ID, vehicle, etc.)
   - affected batch/lot and quantity
   - observed temperature values and time interval (from device/system)
   - immediate actions taken (hold, segregation, notifications)
7. Attach or reference the temperature record (printout, file, screenshot, or system record).

### 6.4 QA assessment and disposition
8. QA reviews the excursion details, temperature profile, and applicable product/material stability information.
9. QA determines disposition (for example: release, reject, rework, additional testing, or extended hold pending investigation).
10. QA documents the rationale for disposition and any additional requirements.
11. Only QA may authorize removal of hold status and return the material to use or release for shipment.

### 6.5 Deviation and CAPA
12. Initiate a deviation record as per the site deviation procedure if:
   - temperature exceeded the specified range, or
   - the excursion duration is unknown, or
   - the excursion may affect quality, safety, or efficacy, or
   - required by internal thresholds/specifications
13. Initiate CAPA if the excursion indicates a recurring issue or system failure.

## 7. Records
- Temperature excursion log or deviation record (as applicable)
- Temperature monitoring record (device/system output)
- QA disposition record and approval
- Related CAPA record (if initiated)

## 8. References
- Site procedure for deviations and investigations
- Applicable material/product specification and stability information
